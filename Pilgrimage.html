        <p>I would like to visit the Vatican City of Rome mainly because of its importance to the Roman Catholic Church as the spiritual and administrative center.
        The Vatican City has a rich history and culture that attracts people interested in exploring its museums, gardens, and ancient ruins.
        It is the smallest independant state in the world, having its own government and economy.</p>

        <p>Israel holds immense significance to Christians worldwide and is home to many religious sites including
        the Mount of Olives, the Sea of Galilee, and the Western Wall in Jerusalem. I would like to pilgrimage to 
        Israel in the future because of its history, culture, and beauty of this unique region.</p>

        <p>Jerusalem, Israel's capital city, is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a history spanning over thousands of years.
          and is considered to be a holy city for the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 
          Anyone who follows these three faiths is therefore instantly interested in visiting.</p>
