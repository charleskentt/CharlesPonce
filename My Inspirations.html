				<h3>David</h3>
				<p>David is a man after God's own heart. Despite his many failures, he always turned back to God and sought His forgiveness. He is one of my favorite because God has always favored him. When he was first introduced, God showed favor upon David despite him being seen as inferior to his brothers. Even the prophet Samuel and David's father did not expect God to choose David as king. In addition, David's Psalms show his heart, how he had complete trust in God claiming that God's faithfulness and His steadfast love endures forever. Lastly, David's psalms also inspire me to praise and worship God.</p>

				<h3>Esther</h3>
				<p>Esther's bravery in standing up for the Jewish people, even at the risk of her own life, encourages me to find the strength within myself to stand up for what is right, even in the face of adversity. Her selflessness and unwavering commitment to protecting her community serve as a powerful reminder that sometimes we must be willing to sacrifice for the greater good. Her unwavering faith and trust in God inspires me to rely on God's guidance in every aspect of my ife. Her story also reminds me that God can use anyone, no matter how unlikely, for His purposes.</p>

				<h5>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle</h5>
				<h3>Paul the Apostle</h3>
				<p>Paul's transformation from a persecutor of Christians to a dedicated follower of Christ is a powerful testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel. He is one of my favorite Biblical personalities because I can relate to his conversion. Like Paul, I also had many shortcomings in the past. In a similar manner as Paul's conversion, my eyes were opened by the grace of God. I now have a desire to spread the Gospel, a desire that I never thought I would have. Furthermore, Paul's teachings on grace, love, and unity in Christ continue to inspire me to perservere.</p>
